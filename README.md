# Global Fertility Decline Analysis 
### Project Overview:
According to the record, The global Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has seen a significant decline, dropping from nearly 5 children per woman 70 years ago to 2.3 children today. This sharp decrease reflects profound changes in global demographic trends, and while it suggests progress in areas like family planning and economic development, it also introduces new uncertainties and challenges. 

This project explores the decline in fertility rates across 20 countries over a 40-year span (1984-2023). The countries are divided into two groups—those with the highest fertility rates and those with the lowest. The analysis aims to uncover the commonalities and differences between these groups and to analyze the relationship between fertility and key factors such as economic sectors, demographics, education, and health system.​

### Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the [World Bank Group](https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&series=SP.DYN.TFRT.IN&country=&_gl=1*1a5qzzn*_gcl_au*MTczNDYzNTAzLjE3MjM4MzUwNjM.#), covering 20 countries from 1984 to 2023, with a total of 8,000 entries. The countries are divided into two groups: the 10 countries with the highest fertility rates and the 10 with the lowest.
